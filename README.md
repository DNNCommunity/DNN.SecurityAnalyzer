# SecurityAnalyzer

The DNN Security Analyzer is a module aimed at helping you to improve the security on your DNN website. This initial version of the module automatically resolves a recently discovered issue with the InstallWizard and provides helpful guidance on other potential configuration issues which might leave your site vulnerable. In addition this release includes the ability to scan your database and files for a specific word or phrase which is useful to help track down defacement issues on your site.

This module will become a standard part of the DNN Platform distribution starting with DNN 7.4.1. We wanted to get this module into the community's hands as quickly as possible and have made this version compatible with DNN 6.2.0 and above.
